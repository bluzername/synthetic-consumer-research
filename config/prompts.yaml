    Product Concept:
    {product_summary}
    
    Market Fit Metrics:
    - PMF Score: {pmf_score}% (target: {pmf_threshold}%+)
    - NPS: {nps}
    - Average Interest: {avg_interest}/5.0
    
    Top Benefits (what's working):
    {top_benefits}

    {top_concerns}
    
    Sample persona feedback:
    {sample_feedback}
    
    Provide a strategic analysis:
    
    1. **Strengths to Amplify**: Identify the 2-3 aspects that are resonating most strongly and how to enhance them further
    
    2. **Critical Gaps**: The 2-3 most significant concerns that are preventing stronger product-market fit
    
    3. **Specific Refinements**: Actionable changes to:
       - Features (what to add, enhance, or modify)
       - Positioning (how to better communicate value)
       - Target market (if adjustments needed)
       - Pricing (if it's a concern)
    
    4. **Strategic Direction**: Should we:
       - Double down on current direction (if PMF is strong)
       - Refine and iterate (if PMF is moderate)
       - Consider a pivot (if PMF is weak)
    
    Be specific and actionable. Focus on changes that will move the PMF score toward the target threshold.
