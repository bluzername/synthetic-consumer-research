## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to Enhanced Metrics (Current)

If you were using an earlier version that relied solely on the traditional 40% PMF threshold:

**What Changed:**
- Primary viability indicator is now **superfan ratio** (10%+ with 5/5 interest + VERY disappointed)
- Strategic recommendations now consider market segmentation more holistically
- Business model recommendations are more specific and actionable

**What You Need To Do:**
- No code changes required - enhanced metrics are backward compatible
- Review the new `get_viability_summary()` method for comprehensive assessment
- Consider using `should_proceed()` method which uses enhanced criteria
- Read ENHANCED_METRICS_PROPOSAL.md for detailed rationale

**Benefits:**
- More realistic thresholds for early-stage concepts
- Better identification of niche opportunities
- More actionable strategic guidance
- Multiple paths to viability (niche vs. mass market)
